## Project Introduction:
We aim to predict whether the compressive strength of concrete surpasses (MPA) given its components/ingredients. 
The data we used for this project was intended for regression, so the threshold value is relatively abitrary and 
was chosen to be the median of the target for convenience to balance the positive and negative classes.

## Methodology:
In our previous investigation, we noticed
