#Baseline:
    -Mode (Check)
    -Use average values for prototype and calc distance from prototype (Check)--> performance drops from 78-73 after normalizing
    -Logistic regression w/ feature engineering 
    -Gradient boosting/random forest etc.
    -Simple NN using Linear and ReLU layers (check)

#Convolutional NN Approach:
    -Implement LeNet (check)
    -Implement another convnet inception modules but for small images(if extra time)
    -Hyperparameter tuning, dropoutRate,size of linear layers, learning rate
    -How to arrange data in space, try a few arrangements
        -Multiple channels
            -Aggregates, cements+plasticizer, others

    -Implement earlystopping
    -Visualize loss curves
    -#Winsorize the outliers
    -Reorganize datasets,dataloaders,utilities etc
    -Feauture engineering for tabular, 
        -find 8 best features,5 best features etc.
        -Remove outliers Winsorize
        -Check for NaNs, zeros, +inf,-inf
    -Test basic convnet
    -Add extra layers
    -Hyperparameter tuning in Google Colab
    -Write everything in a flow in Google colab with a requirements.txt
    -Edit notebook
    -Create presentation Monday evening
